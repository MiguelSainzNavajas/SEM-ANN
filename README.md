# SEM-ANN

This repository shows how to perform a two-staged SEM-ANN analysis in Python code. Adaptations of the TAM and UTAUT2 construct models have been used for its development.
The data sets of both models used for this study were obtained from:
  - Adaptation of TAM model: Luong, Dinh-Hai; Nguyen, Xuan-AN (2021), “Data for: Data on Vietnamese students’ technology acceptance model in distance learning in COVID-19 pandemic”, Mendeley Data, V2, https://doi.org/10.17632/b25j4hc2zg.2

  - Adaptation of UTAUT2 model: Song, Chi-hoon; Kim, Sang Woo; Sohn, Young-woo (2019), “Dataset on Analysis of Users and Non-users in Technology Acceptance”, Mendeley Data, V2, https://doi.org/10.17632/tybx7gmw5s.2
